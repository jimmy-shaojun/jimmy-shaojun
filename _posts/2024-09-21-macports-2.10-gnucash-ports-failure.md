**TLDR**

Wait until ​https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/pull/25835 merged and
use below command to install GnuCash in macOS 15.0 by macports 2.10

```bash
sudo port install gnucash build_arch=x86_64 configure.cflags="-Wno-error=int-conversion -Wno-error=incompatible-function-pointer-types"
```


**Content**

I was using macports because I needed to use macports to install GnuCash in mac so that I could use GnuCash python bindings.

After upgrading to macports 2.10, things went broken. First, dependency `gstreamer1-gst-plugins-bad` failed 

```
Error: Failed to build libffi: command execution failed  
Error: See /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_macports_release_tarballs_ports_devel_libffi/libffi/main.log for details.
Error: Unable to execute port gstreamer1-gst-plugins-bad: upgrade gtk-doc failed
```

I checked logs and found that installation failed because macports built `x86_64` but tried to link `arm64`. I cannot force macports to build all in `arm64` because GnuCash depends on `rust` which only supports `x86_64` in mac.

I then tried 

```bash
sudo port clean libdbi-drivers && sudo port install libdbi-drivers build_arch=x86_64
```

but then logs indicated that 

```bash
error: incompatible integer to pointer conversion passing 'intptr_t' (aka 'long') to parameter of type 'const void *' [-Wint-conversion]
```

and

```bash
error: incompatible function pointer types passing ..... [-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types]
```

I then tried below and finally got libdbi-drivers installed.

```bash
sudo port clean libdbi-drivers && sudo port install libdbi-drivers build_arch=x86_64 configure.cflags="-Wno-error=int-conversion -Wno-error=incompatible-function-pointer-types"
```

To avoid possible errors, I tried to install GnuCash with below command

```bash
sudo port install gnucash build_arch=x86_64 configure.cflags="-Wno-error=int-conversion -Wno-error=incompatible-function-pointer-types"
```

I still see errors

```bash
Error: Failed to build at-spi2-core: command execution failed
```

Checking logs I find

```bash

Looks like I need to wait until this PR merged
